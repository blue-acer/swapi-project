# SwapiProject

This is a companion project for [swapi-backend](https://github.com/blue-acer/swapi-backend) and acts as the front-end application for displaying a list of Star Wars characters. The back-end application consumes the data from SWAPI and makes selected fields of the data objects available to the front-end application.

Currently, the user can search all 3 columns.

To replicate the setup, used when creating this app (and its companion swapi-backend), here is information on the configuration used at the time.

Angular CLI: 17.0.7

Node: 20.10.0

Package Manager: npm 10.2.5

OS: win32 x64

There is presently no testing in place for this application.

Future improvements to this application would be:

- Custom searching/filtering of the table rows
- Making the names clickable and redirecting to further information
- Re-evaluating the UI

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
